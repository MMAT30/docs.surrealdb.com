# Ranges

A range is composed of `..` and possible delimiters to set the maximum and minimum possible values. The default syntax includes the lower limit and excludes the upper limit. A `=` can be used to make the upper limit inclusive, and `>` can be used to make the lower limit exclusive.

```surql
-- From 0 up to 9
0..10;
-- From 0 up to 10
0..=10
-- From 1 to 9
0>..10;
-- From 1 to 10
0>..=10 
```

A range becomes open ended if a delimiter is not specified.

```surql
-- Anything from 0 and up
0..
-- Anything from 1 and up
0>..
-- Anything up to 99
..100
-- Anything up to 100
..=100
-- An infinite range
..
```

A range can be constructed from any type of value. This is most useful when comparing one value to another.

```surql
-- All true
'g' IN 'a'..'z';
d"2024-01-01" IN d"2020-01-01"..=d"2025-01-01";
['London', d"2022-02-02", 5.7] IN ['London', d"2020-01-01"]..=['London', d"2024-12-31"];
-- All false
"ㅋㅋㅋ" IN "a".."z";
d"2028-01-01" IN d"2020-01-01"..=d"2025-01-01";
['Philadelphia', d"2022-02-02", 5.7] IN ['London', d"2020-01-01"]..=['London', d"2024-12-31"];
```

## Integer ranges

Ranges of integers have the added convenience of being able to be used in a `FOR` loop.

```surql
FOR $year IN 0..=2024 {
    CREATE historical_events SET
        for_year = $year,
        events = "To be added";
}
```
